NRJavaSerial is a Java library
enabling access to [serial ports][ser].
It's a fork of the now-defunct RXTX library
with a focus on ease of use and embeddability.
The Java APIs and native components
are distributed within a single JAR,
easing integration with other projects.
Additionally, numerous issues
found within the last released version of RXTX
have been resolved,
and new features are being added.
For more information, see the [GitHub project][gh-nrjs].
